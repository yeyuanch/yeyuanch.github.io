## Food

- Most things local in China, especially food in Shandong, Hunan (spicy) and Shanghai.

- Most things non-Chinese in the US, especially burgers and Indian food.

- Fried chicken in KFC, which is the most consistent flavor in China and in the US.

- Traditional Japanese food are too simply flavored (and taste similar). I prefer Yoshinoya and Matsuya.

- I can't say anything special for Bulgarian food, but they really make good food.

## Puzzle Games

- Baba is you

- Patrick's Parabox

- 14 Minesweeper Variants

- Bean and nothingness (recommended by Yeyuan Chen)

- A=B

- IMO / ICPC (?)

## Rhythm Games

- I am familiar with almost all rhythm games, especially mobile ones.

- See my [best score](/../images/testify.jpg) and also my [favorite song](/../images/corps.jpg) from the game [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/). I am a top-200 player in Arcaea. 

- Also see a [poster](/../images/tusile.pdf) (in Chinese) that I made for a series of rhythm game cups in Tsinghua University.
