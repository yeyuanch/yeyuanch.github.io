# About me

I am currently a second-year PhD student at University of Michigan and luckily being advised by [Prof. Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/). I am at INSAIT this fall as a visiting student. I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science and mathematics, especially in graph algorithms and combinatorics.

Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate student in [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), Tsinghua University. During the spring and summer of 2022, I visited the wonderful [theory group](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/theory-of-computation/) of UM and worked closely with [Prof. Seth Pettie](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/) and [Prof. Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/).

I love theoretical thinking, for both research problems and ICPC- or IMO- style questions, also puzzle games for fun.
